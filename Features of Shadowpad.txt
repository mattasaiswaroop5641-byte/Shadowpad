🔐 Security & Encryption (The Core)
End-to-End Encryption (E2E):
Algorithm: Uses AES-256-GCM for message encryption.
Protocol: Implements a Double Ratchet algorithm (similar to Signal/WhatsApp) for forward secrecy.
Key Derivation: Uses PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations) to derive keys from the room password, followed by HKDF for chain keys.
Admin Blindness: The server only stores encrypted blobs (ciphertext, iv, salt, step). It cannot read the content.
Verification: A "Verify Encryption" tool in settings allows users to audit the cryptographic proof and latency in real-time.
Hybrid Storage System:
MongoDB Atlas: Persists encrypted data for up to 30 days.
Memory Fallback: Automatically switches to RAM-only mode if the database connection fails, ensuring the app never goes down.
Auto-Destruction: Pads are automatically deleted from the database if not accessed for 30 days (TTL index).
👥 Collaboration & Room Management
Dual Modes:
Room Style: Full collaboration suite with sidebars for users, activity logs, and files.
Notepad Style: Distraction-free, minimalist editor with a "Security Gold" border and specific encryption controls.
Real-Time Sync: Instant text synchronization using WebSockets (Socket.IO).
Host Authority System:
Creator is King: The room creator is automatically assigned Host (👑) status.
Auto-Migration: If the Host leaves, ownership is automatically transferred to the next user in the list.
Promote Host: The Host can manually transfer ownership to another user.
User Limits: Configurable slider to set max users per room (Range: 2 to 100).
🛡️ Permissions & Moderation
Granular Permissions: The Host can toggle specific rights for the whole room or individual users:
✏️ Allow Edit: Enable/disable typing in the editor.
📤 Allow Upload: Enable/disable file sharing.
🗑️ Allow Delete: Enable/disable deleting files.
Strict Enforcement: Server-side checks prevent users from bypassing UI restrictions (e.g., trying to upload when disabled).
Kick/Ban:
Host Kick: The Host can remove any user from the room.
Admin Kick: The System Admin can kick users via the Admin Panel.
✍️ Editor & Tools
Rich Toolbar:
Formatting: Bold (**), Italic (*), Code ( `).
Actions: Copy Room Link, Clear Editor, Download as .txt.
Live Statistics: Real-time Character and Word counters.
Typing Indicators: Shows (typing...) next to a user's name in the list.
Encrypted Actions (Notepad Mode):
Secure Save: Encrypts current state and pushes to MongoDB.
Encrypted Exit: Saves, clears local state, and leaves.
Delete Pad: Permanently removes the encrypted blob from the database.
📂 File Sharing
Secure Transfer: Share files up to 25MB.
Drag & Drop: Upload zone supports dragging files directly into the browser.
File Management:
Download: Users can download shared files.
Delete: Users (with permission) can remove files from the shared list.
🔧 Admin Panel ("God Mode")
Secure Dashboard: Protected by a hardcoded secret key.
Live Monitoring:
View all active rooms and the number of users.
IP Tracking: View the IP address of every connected user.
Database Management:
Storage Stats: View total pads and storage usage.
Expiration Status: Color-coded badges showing days remaining before auto-deletion.
Bulk Cleanup: One-click tool to delete pads older than X days.
Nuclear Option: "Drop Database" button to wipe all data instantly.
🧩 UX & Small Details
Theming:
Dark/Light Mode: Toggle switch in settings, persisted in localStorage.
Custom Scrollbars: Styled to match the active theme.
Input Sanitization:
Room IDs are automatically converted to uppercase.
Prefixes (ROOM:, NOTE:) are handled automatically in the URL and inputs.
Visual Feedback:
Connection Status: Green dot indicator in the nav bar.
Lock Icon: Visual confirmation when encryption is active.
Loading States: "Establishing secure connection..." overlay.
Toast/Alerts: Custom alerts for errors (wrong password, room full).
Password Visibility: Eye icon (👁️/🙈) to toggle password masking in forms.
Activity Log: A scrolling log of events (User joined, User left, File uploaded, Host changed).
